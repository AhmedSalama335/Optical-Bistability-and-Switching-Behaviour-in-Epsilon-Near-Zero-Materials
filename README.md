# Optical-Bistability-and-Switching-Behaviour-in-Epsilon-Near-Zero-Materials
Implementing new material models in Ansys Lumerical's material database where we need to use C++. Each C++ file represent a material model. The models describes the nonlinear behavior in ENZ materials that results in bistability and switching behavior in these materials. The ongoing research, led by Prof. Humeyra Caglayan, Tampere University, focuses on developing nonlinear plugin material material models that descirbes the nonlinearity in ENZ materials using Lumerical FDTD. The research was done by Ahmed Salama under the supervision of Prof. Humeyra Caglayan.
