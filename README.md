# Optical-Bistability-and-Switching-Behaviour-in-Epsilon-Near-Zero-Materials
Implementing new material models in Ansys Lumerical's material database where we need to use C++. Each C++ file represent a material model. The models describes the nonlinear behavior in ENZ materials that results in bistability and switching behavior in these materials.
